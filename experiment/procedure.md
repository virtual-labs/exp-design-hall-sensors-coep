### Procedure

#### Prerequisite : 
- Attempt all questions.

#### Use "Reference table" button to get hall coefficients for different materials.

##### Application type : Measurement of Current

- Step 1 : Configure hall sensor parameters: material, flux density, current and thickness. 

- Step 2 : Click on "simulation" button.

- Step 3 : Click on green button to start mimic.

- Step 4 : Calculate hall sensor output for change in current.

- Step 5 : Enter the answer in textbox and click on "Submit" button.

- Step 6 : Repeat the above steps for five readings.

- Step 7 : Observe above sensor output for different material.

##### Application type : Measurement of Thickness

- Step 8 : Select another application type for thickness.

- Step 9 : Repeat Step 1 to Step 5 for change in thickness.

- Step 10 : To get observation table and graph click on "Show Result" button.
